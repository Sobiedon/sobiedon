    <p>

        My name is Julienne Sobie Don, I am originally from West Africa (Cote D'Ivoire). I moved to the United State in 2012 for school.
        <br>

        I lived in Maryland where I graduated from high school; after that I went to college in Houston to study Business Administration. I always had a love for technology so I decided to move to Omaha and study Management Information Systems, which allows me to use both my business skills and my technology skills in the technology industry. I have 4 yearsâ€™ experience in the technology industry. I interned at Client resources, University of Nebraska Omaha and at Union Pacific, building software, testing software, writing business rules and test scenarios. I continued to build my skills and to grow in every opportunity, and I also bring my knowledge and skills to organizations.

        <br>
        <br>
        In my free time, I enjoy going to farmers markets, gardening, maintaining my plants, watching TV series, sewing, cooking, and enjoying good food and restaurants.

        <I>"I remember vividly during my first year in the United States I was asked what I love the most about Africa and why?
            My response was our love for our communities, as I was raised with those values."</I>
